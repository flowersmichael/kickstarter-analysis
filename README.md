# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client is interested in launching a Kickstarter campaign to fund a theater production. In this analysis we reviewed Kickstarter campaign data to determine what factors might contribute to whether or not a campaign succeeds or fails. 

We zeroed in on two specific factors:

*Launch Date: What time of year the campaign is launched?

*Goals: What's the targeted amount of money being raised in the campaign?

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help our client make informed decisions and increase the probability that her campaign will be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
For our analysis we looked closely at outcomes based on Launch Date, and outcomes based on Goals. For both Launch Date and Goals, we grouped campaigns by their outcomes: successful, failed, canceled, or live (ongoing).

For Launch Date, we included all campaigns in the Theater Parent Category. Such campaigns included Plays, Musicals, and Spaces.

For Goals, we looked specifically at Plays.

We filtered out all live campaigns for our analysis since the outcome of these campaigns is unknown at this point.

Our data set includes campaigns from over 20 countries for the years 2009 through 2017. These characteristics of the data set highlight some limitations of our analysis. For one thing, our client's play is targeted for release in the United States, and these data include all countries. We could limit our analysis to US data but that would decrease the sample size. Also, it's now 2020 and our data only goes through 2017, so the data is somewhat stale.

Most importantly, the onset of COVID-19 is likely the greatest determinant regarding the success or failure of campaigns such as theater plays that involve crowd gatherings. It's best to consider this analysis as a helpful resource for when the pandemic subsides and life in the U.S. returns to normal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking at the chart below, it's clear that most successful campaigns are launched in the early summer months of May, June, and July. More theater plays are launched in these three months than any other months, but the key takeaway is that the success:failure ratio is highest during these months.

Theater campaigns launched in May and June are not only the most successful in terms of total campaigns, but also in terms of success:failute.

We can generally ignore the canceled plays with respect to launch date because the number of plays canceled is very small and also steady over the course of the year.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
